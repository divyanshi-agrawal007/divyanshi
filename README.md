Week 1 and 2, 
I set up VS Code and started learning HTML and CSS. I understood how to make a basic webpage using things like headings, forms, and tables, and also learned how to add colors, fonts, and spacing to make it look better.

Week 3, 
I made my first portfolio page using HTML and CSS. I practiced arranging things properly on the page and tried to make it look clean and organized.

Week 4, 
I started learning JavaScript. I learned what variables and functions are, and how to make a webpage do small actions like reacting to a button click. It was fun to see the page become interactive.
